# librosa-aarch64
A block for using Librosa on aarch64 architecture devices.

[Librosa](https://librosa.org/) is a popular audio and music processing tool for Python. It is notoriously difficult to build for aarch64 devices such as the Pi4, Coral Dev and Jetson boards. Simply add this block to an existing project and/or extend it for your own needs.

Work in progress - will be released in balenaBlocks repo soon...
